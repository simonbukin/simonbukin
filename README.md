## Hello!

I'm a UX Engineer focused on creating excellent experiences focused on users. I'm passionate about optimizizing user experiences and exploring the rabbit hole that is frontend web development.

- ðŸŒ± I've been learning Svelte + SvelteKit and have been loving it. My [new (WIP) personal website](https://personal-website-bay-eight.vercel.app/) is built with it!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about UX, the quest for a perfect espresso shot, and how to find obscure music.

## Hello!

I'm a UX Engineer focused on creating excellent experiences focused on users. I'm passionate about optimizing user experiences and exploring the rabbit hole that is frontend web development.

- 🎴 I recently developed [Fateseal](fateseal.com), a tool for exporting Magic The Gathering decks to use in Tabletop Simulator. I don't play as much as I once did, but Magic nights with friends are now easier to set up!
- 📰 I've been working on an automated newsletter app to send myself digests on a weekly cadence. It's been fun to leverage GitHub Actions more!
- - 🌱 I've been learning Svelte / SvelteKit and have been having a blast. My [personal website](https://www.simonbukin.com) is built with it (though Astro is looking tempting...)!

## Hello!

I'm a UX Engineer focused on creating excellent experiences focused on users. I'm passionate about optimizing user experiences and exploring the rabbit hole that is frontend web development.

- 🌱 I've been learning Svelte + SvelteKit and have been loving it. My [personal website](https://www.simonbukin.com) is built with it!
- 🔭 I'm getting married this year, and have been working on an [RSVP tracking website](https://simonandkaylawedd.ing) with Next.js. 
- 💬 Ask me about UX, the quest for a perfect espresso shot, and how to find obscure music.
- 📫 Drop me [a line](mailto:from-github@sbukin.anonaddy.com)

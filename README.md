## Hello!

I'm a UX Engineer focused on creating excellent experiences focused on users. I'm passionate about optimizing user experiences and exploring the rabbit hole that is frontend web development.

- 🌱 I've been learning Svelte / SvelteKit this year and have been having a blast. My [personal website](https://www.simonbukin.com) is built with it!
- 🔭 I got married this year, and  developed an [RSVP tracking website](https://simonandkaylawedd.ing) with Astro & Supabase. This previously existed as a Solid, NextJS, and a plain React app.
